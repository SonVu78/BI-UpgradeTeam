This is my course project: BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM
The name of the topic is: BUILD A DATA WAREHOUSE IN AZURE CLOUD BASE ON THE ADVENTUREWORKS 2019 DATABASE

In this project, I collaborated with my team to design a galaxy schema data model and build a data warehouse for Sales and Purchasing. The data warehouse consist of 8 dim tables and 2 fact tables. 
 
We used data from AdvantureWorks 2019 database. 
To ETL data from source into date warehouse, data pipelines were built and monitored on Azure Data Factory.

This repository contains all data pipelines in JSON format.
